## ["How to Grow as an Engineer (Working Remotely)"](https://open.nytimes.com/how-to-grow-as-an-engineer-working-remotely-3baff8211f3e)

> "As an engineer, you're not paid to write code; you're paid to solve problems."

Simply said, but genuine. The article brings up major points, such as striving for simplicity, being passionate, and so on. But in almost all of these facets, "growing" involved being better for the team, not for oneself. The first headline says, "Solve the right problems."

> "It's also not enough to just solve any problems. You need to be solving the right ones...Solving the right problems means working on tasks that bring the most positive impact to your _team_"

Until recently, I believed the trapped stereotype that software engineering seems to hold -- a 9-5 independent work schedule mainly centered around staring at a screen (or maybe two or three) involving little interaction with people and the world around you.

Look up ["Pros and Cons of Software Engineering"](https://honestproscons.com/pros-and-cons-of-software-engineering/) and you'll find common pros like high pay, good demand, respect; but you'll also find "no social activity" as a con. If you look a bit deeper, you'll probably also find that the author just writes pros and cons lists of just about anything (even "14 Pros and Cons of Flat Roofing Systems", gotta check that one out)!

Anyhow, it's becoming more and more clear to me that no matter how much time software engineers might spend interacting with a machine, it doesn't detract from the social interaction they have with people either. Maturing in this field might have little to do with learning 20+ languages, and more to do with being a better teammate. At least, that's what I got from this article.

I agree that much of problem solving in software development is effective communication and clear messaging. This is why it is typical for product managers, who are key players in the Agile environment, [have marketing or communications degrees](https://work.chron.com/education-need-product-manager-2487.html).

*It is interesting to see how many think that becoming a software engineer would come with the lack of social intereactions. I can't say I have not also believed in this stereotype, but learning more about this field made me realize that it was the opposite. In the field you work in teams and connect with all the different people related to the project which makes you as sociable as any other job! -Michelle Han*
